Ozyegin University 21/22 Spring CS391 Project

Atahan Tuncel and Ali Fuat Öztürk worked on this project. 

In this project our main goal was to create a flag quiz app. Users would register and then select their preferred continent to be tested from. Each question would have 4 answers for users to pick from. There are 5 choices included for continents. Since there are only 3 countries on North Americe we merged the continent with South America and called that choice "Americas". Users can register with their emails. During the test a score is kept according to the users' performance. 

A usage scenario is that the user registers with their email address and then chooses a continent. Then the quiz page opens and a question appears on page. After selecting one of the four options, next question will be displayed if the question number isn't six already. 

Project work has been distributed equally.
